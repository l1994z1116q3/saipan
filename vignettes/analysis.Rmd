This is my first R Markdown document.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(saipan)

x <- gather_data(tickers = c("MSFT", "IBM"))
```


This is my first plot.

And now another sentence.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- make_plot(x, ticker = "IBM")
print(p)
```

This is the end of my document.
